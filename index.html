    <h1>
        First Time Using Git
    </h1>

    <p>
        Git is a version control system that is widely used for software development and other version control tasks.
         It provides a way to track changes to source code and other files, as well as revert back to previous versions
          if needed and also to collaborate with other developers on projects.
           It is widely used by software development teams and has become an essential tool in the software development workflow.
        Git stores changes to files as "commits", which are grouped into "branches". By default, there is a main branch called "master",
     but developers can create and work on other branches as well. This allows multiple people to work on the same codebase simultaneously,
  and makes it easy to merge changes back into the main branch when they are ready.

Git also has powerful collaboration features, such as the ability to "push" and "pull" changes to and from a central repository,
 and to create "pull requests" for code review. These features make it easy for teams to work together on software projects,
  even if they are located in different parts of the world.
